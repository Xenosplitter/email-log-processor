Logs start and stop times of data communication logs, for private use.

Assumed data is a unique identifier for a hypothetical bank, the time of day the communication occured, and the date the communication occured.

The script would then output a .csv reporting the start, stop, and duration of commication per bank.

Known issues involve data occuring in more than a 24 hour window and multiple instances of communication happening in the same day.
